Hello, I'm- hey, you already know my name.

## Programming in my life

I started programming in 2020 with Blockly and Python.

## Languages

Portuguese/English - I wish I knew Dutch just to read Kafka

## Projects

A movie review website was my last project at technical school. I developed the register/login back-end, set up the database with Firebase, and attempted to stylize the user profile page. I'm not very skilled at making things 'pretty,' so one of my colleagues had to make a good one and his version was really good.

gorjj is derived from "gorjear" (which means "tweet", the _chirp of a small or young bird_ in Portuguese). Inspired by the most popular micro-blogging platform, gorjj is a very simple project I made to learn how to set up a website with Apache (to create a server), MariaDB (to store posts), and PHP (to perform the magic).
